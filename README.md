# Car Number Plate Detection

## Overview

The Car Number Plate Detection project is designed to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images and videos. This project uses deep learning techniques to identify and extract number plates from vehicles, making it useful for applications like automated parking systems, traffic monitoring, and vehicle registration.

## Features

- **Number Plate Detection:** Detects number plates from images and videos using a trained deep learning model.
- **Number Plate Recognition:** Extracts and reads the alphanumeric characters from the detected number plates.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Processes video feeds in real-time for live applications.
- **Support for Multiple Plate Formats:** Recognizes various formats of number plates.

## Installation

To set up the Car Number Plate Detection project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/gaurav-bhadane/Car-Number-Plate-Detection.git`

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   `cd Car-Number-Plate-Detection`

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   `python -m venv venv`
   `source venv/bin/activate `

4. **Install the Required Dependencies:**
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Model Training

To train a custom model, follow these steps:

  1. Prepare your dataset in the specified format.
  2. Update the training configuration in train.py.
  3. Run the training script: `python train.py`
